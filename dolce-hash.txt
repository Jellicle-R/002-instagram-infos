At the @italiainminiatura two of the greatest representations of the baroque are exposed in their miniature size: the #DGGirlsMicroBag, with the eye-catching baroque inspired DG Logo on the front and the Reggia di Caserta, one of the biggest baroque palaces in Europe that is home to one of the greatest royal gardens. #DGFattoAMano #MadeInItaly
Through the midst of the columns of the magnificent Pisa Cathedral in its miniature version recreated in the @italiainminiatura, the #DGDevotionMicroBag catches the eye, with is pure essence made of craftsmanship, art, tradition and passion. #DGFattoAMano #MadeInItaly
When giant pieces of history became little itâ€™s all about details and mastery. The #DGAmoreMicroBag and the Michelangeloâ€™s David replica situated in Piazza della Signoria in Florence, while the original one is at the Galleria Dellâ€™Accademia, represent #MadeInItaly elegance and sophistication. #DGFattoAMano  Special thanks to @italiainminiatura.
Two of the finest examples of greatness in miniature are perfectly matching. The Miniature of San Pietro Cupola in Rome, a masterpiece of creative menâ€™s thinking, originally designed by Michelangelo Buonarroti and recreated in Miniature in six months by few artisans, meets the #DGDevotionMicroBag: the maximum expression of passion, craftsmanship and meticulousness. #DGFattoAMano #MadeInItaly @italiainminiatura
In the magical frame of @italiainminiatura, where the greatest Italian Monuments are represented on a scale from 1:25 to 1:50, two tiny splendors meet: the Greek Theatre of Siracusa, in reality one of the largest in the world and the likely setting for the works of Aeschylus and other Ancient Greek tragedies, and the #DGSicily58MicroBag with precious and unmistakable artistry. #DGFattoAMano #MadeInItaly
Miniature versions of grandeur are together in the @italiainminiatura. The architectural landmarks of the city of Turin meet the #DGAmoreMicroBag speaking a story of art and beauty. Palazzo Madama is here in the background with tiny Alps and the Mole Antonelliana, the real one is 167.5 meters height. #DGFattoAMano #MadeInItaly
Essential and of high tailored quality, the tube dress with a seductive neckline in powdery rose pink with matching accessories is a portrait of elegance. #DGWomen #DGFamily

For your next special event, dress up in the powdery pink ballerina dress by Dolce&Gabbana, made of light and ethereal tulle for the refined and romantic woman.  #DGWomen #DGFamily
Different sized polka dots paired together in new colour variations of pink and maroon symbolise a new concept of femininity in this #DGWomen collection. #DGFamily
Timeless polka-dots are reinterpreted in new colours with unique shapes and volumes. Pictured in an art gallery, this feminine attitude is tracked back to the styles of the 30s and 50s in a look of retro modernity. #DGWomen #DGFamily
A new concept of femininity is brought to life with shirts embellished by volants, perfectly paired with high-waisted pants and embellished with statement jewellery ribbons and colourful pink stones. #DGWomen #DGFamily

The embroideries, executed entirely by hand, embellish every sartorial creation. Sequins, feathers, pearls, jet beading, bugle beads and crystals design marvellous patterns on the surface of the garments.

The clothes presented in the Valley of the Temples are inspired by the beauty of female divinities like Aphrodite, Athena, Tyche or Artemis. Incessant attention to detail is the hallmark of every Alta Moda creation.
